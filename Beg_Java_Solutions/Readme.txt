The files containing the source code for the exercises in a given chapter appear
in a folder with a name corresponding to the chapter. The solutions to the exercises
appear in subfolders to the chapter folder, so files in folders sol1, sol2, sol3, and sol4,
that appear as subfolders to the folder ch11 are the solutions to Exercise 1, Exercise 2,
Exercise 3, and Exercise 4 that are at the end of Chapter 4.

The solutions are not the only possible solutions to the exercises, nor are they necessarily
the best solutions. If your solution is different and works, it is likely it is a perfectly
good solution, and possibly a better one!

You should be able to tell whether your solution is better that the one that appears here
by comparing the source code.

Enjoy your Java programming!
